**Auchentoshan distillery is a single malt whisky distillery in the west of Scotland. The name Auchentoshan is from 
Gaelic Achadh an Oisein and translates as "corner of the field". The distillery is also known as "Glasgow's Malt 
Whisky" due to its proximity to Glasgow and "the breakfast whisky" due to its sweet and delicate nature. Auchentoshan 
is located at the foot of the Kilpatrick Hills on the outskirts of Clydebank in West Dunbartonshire near the Erskine 
Bridge. It is one of six malt whisky distilleries in the Scottish Lowlands along with Bladnoch, Glenkinchie and 
recently Daftmill Distillery, Annandale Distillery and Ailsa Bay Distillery.**
